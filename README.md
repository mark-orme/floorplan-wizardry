## üöÄ Project Overview

This application allows architects, designers, and homeowners to:

- Create multi-floor building plans
- Draw rooms and walls with accurate measurements
- Calculate Gross Internal Area (GIA) automatically
- Save and export floor plans as images

## ‚ú® Features

### Drawing Tools

- **Smart Snapping**: Objects snap to grid points for alignment
- **Real-time Measurements**: Display distances and areas as you draw
- **Scale Management**: Work in real-world measurements (meters)

### Floor Management
- **Multi-floor Support**: Create and switch between multiple floor plans
- **Floor Organization**: Name and organize floors logically
- **Copy Between Floors**: Duplicate elements across different floors

### Calculation Features
- **Area Calculation**: Automatic calculation of room areas
- **Total Floor Area**: Calculate Gross Internal Area (GIA) for each floor
- **Measurement Display**: Show dimensions on the plan

- **Export Options**: Save your work as PNG images
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and tablet devices
- **Touch & Stylus Support**: Optimized for drawing with stylus devices
- **Local Storage**: Work is automatically saved locally

## üîß Technical Implementation

The application is built using:

- **React 18+** with TypeScript for the UI and application logic
- **Fabric.js** for canvas manipulation and drawing tools
- **Tailwind CSS** with shadcn/ui for responsive design components
- **IndexedDB** for local storage of floor plans
- **Supabase** for cloud storage and user authentication
- **React Query** for efficient data fetching and state management

### Architecture

The application follows a component-based architecture with:

- **Canvas Components**: Handle rendering and user interaction
- **Utility Functions**: Manage geometry calculations and data processing
- **Custom Hooks**: Separate logic concerns (drawing, resizing, history, etc.)
- **Context Providers**: Manage application state and user preferences

#### Grid System Architecture

The application implements a robust grid system with:

- **Modular Hook Design**: Specialized hooks for different grid functionalities
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry mechanisms and fallback grid rendering
- **Performance Optimization**: Throttling and batched operations for smooth performance
- **Safety Mechanisms**: Lock acquisition and timeout protection to prevent rendering issues

## üö¶ Getting Started

To run this project locally:

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Navigate to the project directory
cd floorplan-designer

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## üåê Browser Support

The application works best in modern browsers:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

## üìñ Usage Guide

1. **Select a Drawing Tool**:
   - Freehand: Draw irregular shapes
   - Line: Create precise straight lines with measurements
   - Room: Draw enclosed spaces with area calculation
   - Wall: Create walls with proper thickness

2. **Use the Grid for Precision**:
   - The grid shows 0.1m intervals with darker lines at 1.0m
   - Drawing snaps to grid points for accuracy
   - Toggle grid visibility or change density as needed

3. **Create and Manage Floors**:
   - Add a new floor with the "+" button
