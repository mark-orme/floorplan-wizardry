# Testing Strategy

## Testing Approach

The project uses a comprehensive testing approach with multiple layers:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Focus on utility functions and hooks
   - Test edge cases and error conditions
   - Mock external dependencies

2. **Component Tests**:
   - Test key user interactions
   - Verify correct rendering and state updates
   - Use the testing-library approach (test behavior, not implementation)

3. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test workflows across multiple components
   - Verify data flow and state management
   - Test real-world user scenarios

4. **Canvas Testing**:
   - Use the canvas mock for fabric.js operations
   - Verify proper object creation and manipulation
   - Test canvas event handling

## Canvas Testing Strategy

Canvas components require special testing approaches:

```typescript
// Example canvas test with mocking
test('creates grid lines on canvas', () => {
  // Setup mock canvas
  const mockCanvas = createMockFabricCanvas();
  
  // Call the function to test
  const gridObjects = createBasicGrid(mockCanvas);
  
  // Verify results
  expect(gridObjects.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  expect(mockCanvas.add).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(gridObjects.length);
});
```

## Grid Testing

When testing grid functions:

1. **Mock Canvas**:
   - Create a proper mock for FabricCanvas
   - Implement necessary methods (add, remove, contains, etc.)
   - Simulate canvas dimensions

2. **Test Cases**:
   - Test with valid canvas
   - Test with null/undefined canvas
   - Test with invalid dimensions
   - Test with existing grid objects
   - Test error recovery mechanisms

3. **Validation**:
   - Verify grid objects are created correctly
   - Check proper styling is applied
   - Validate error handling works as expected

## Performance Testing

Performance tests focus on:

1. **Rendering Performance**: Frame rates during operations
2. **Memory Usage**: Detecting memory leaks
3. **Load Time**: Initial loading performance
4. **Interaction Responsiveness**: Response time to user actions
