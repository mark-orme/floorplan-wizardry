# ADR 0001: Canvas Plugin System Architecture

## Date: 2025-04-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The floor plan editor application needs a flexible way to extend functionality without modifying core components. As the application grows, we need to:

1. Allow third-party developers to add new tools and capabilities
2. Maintain a clean separation between core canvas functionality and specialized tools
3. Support dynamically loading tools based on user needs
4. Ensure type safety across plugin boundaries
5. Maintain performance when loading multiple plugins

## Decision

We will implement a plugin-based architecture for the canvas system with the following characteristics:

1. **Plugin Registry**: A central registry that manages plugin registration and discovery
2. **Standard Plugin Interface**: A well-defined interface that all plugins must implement
3. **Lazy Loading**: Support for dynamic loading of plugins only when needed
4. **Isolated State Management**: Each plugin manages its own state
5. **Type-Safe Extension Points**: Strongly-typed extension points for plugins to hook into

### Implementation Details

1. Each plugin will be packaged as a separate module with a standard entry point
2. Plugins will register themselves with the core application via a registration API
3. The core application will provide a plugin host component that renders active plugins
4. Communication between plugins and the core will happen through a defined event system
5. Plugins will have access to a restricted API for interacting with the canvas

```typescript
// Plugin Interface
export interface CanvasPlugin {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  version: string;
  initialize(api: CanvasPluginAPI): void;
  cleanup(): void;
  getTools(): CanvasTool[];
  getComponents(): PluginComponent[];
}

// Plugin API Interface
export interface CanvasPluginAPI {
  registerTool(tool: CanvasTool): void;
  registerComponent(component: PluginComponent): void;
  getCanvasState(): CanvasState;
  addEventListener(event: string, callback: Function): void;
  removeEventListener(event: string, callback: Function): void;
}
```

## Consequences

### Benefits
1. **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new features without core modifications
2. **Modularity**: Better separation of concerns between core canvas and tools
3. **Performance**: Lazy loading reduces initial bundle size
4. **Maintainability**: Plugins can be developed, tested, and deployed independently
5. **Type Safety**: TypeScript interfaces ensure correct plugin integration

### Risks
1. **Version Compatibility**: Plugin API changes could break existing plugins
2. **Performance Impact**: Multiple active plugins might affect performance
3. **Security Concerns**: Plugin sandbox limitations need careful consideration
4. **Testing Complexity**: More configurations to test as plugins multiply
5. **Documentation Overhead**: Need to maintain both internal and external documentation

### Mitigations
1. Implement a plugin versioning system to manage compatibility
2. Create a performance monitoring system for plugins
3. Establish a security review process for third-party plugins
4. Develop a comprehensive testing strategy for plugins
5. Create and maintain detailed plugin development documentation

## Implementation Plan

1. Phase 1: Create core plugin system architecture and basic extension points
2. Phase 2: Refactor existing tools as internal plugins
3. Phase 3: Create documented API for third-party plugin development
4. Phase 4: Build plugin marketplace and distribution mechanism
