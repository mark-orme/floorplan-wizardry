# ADR 0001: Web Workers for Geometry Calculations

## Date: 2024-04-21

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The floor plan application requires complex geometry calculations for area measurements, path simplification, and grid snapping. These calculations can become computationally intensive, especially with large floor plans or when multiple operations need to be performed simultaneously. This poses several challenges:

1. Performance bottlenecks on the main thread
2. UI responsiveness issues during heavy calculations
3. Need for real-time feedback during drawing operations
4. Resource management for complex geometry operations

## Decision

We will implement a Web Worker-based architecture for geometry calculations with the following components:

1. A dedicated GeometryWorker for handling intensive calculations
2. A client module (geometryWorkerClient.ts) that provides a clean API for the main thread
3. TypeScript interfaces for type-safe communication between threads
4. Structured message passing for operation queuing and results handling

Key implementation details:
- Worker operations will be Promise-based for clean async handling
- Messages will be strongly typed with TypeScript
- Operations will be queued and processed sequentially
- Results will be cached where appropriate

## Consequences

### Benefits
- Improved UI responsiveness by offloading calculations
- Better CPU utilization across cores
- Cleaner separation of concerns between UI and geometry logic
- Simplified testing of geometry operations in isolation
- Enhanced scalability for complex calculations

### Risks
- Increased complexity in data flow and state management
- Potential overhead from data serialization
- Need to handle worker initialization and error states
- Browser compatibility considerations

### Mitigations
- Clear TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Robust error handling in worker communication
- Fallback mechanisms for browsers without worker support
- Comprehensive testing of worker initialization and message passing

## Implementation Plan

1. Create base worker infrastructure
2. Migrate existing geometry calculations
3. Add performance monitoring
4. Implement caching strategy
5. Add error recovery mechanisms
