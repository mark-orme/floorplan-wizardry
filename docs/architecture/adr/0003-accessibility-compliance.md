# 3. Accessibility Compliance Strategy

Date: 2025-04-22

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As our application is used in professional environments for floor plan creation and editing, we need to ensure it's accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. This requires a comprehensive approach to accessibility testing and compliance.

## Decision

We will implement a multi-layered approach to accessibility:

1. **Component-level testing** with jest-axe to catch accessibility issues during development
2. **E2E testing** with Playwright and AxeBuilder to test complete user flows
3. **CI integration** through Lighthouse CI and custom SLO monitoring
4. **Manual keyboard navigation testing** for drawing tools and interactive components
5. **Documentation** of accessibility features and known limitations

## Consequences

### Positive

- Improved user experience for all users, including those with disabilities
- Earlier detection of accessibility issues in the development process
- Compliance with accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Reduced risk of legal issues related to accessibility

### Negative

- Additional development and testing overhead
- Some complex canvas interactions may have limited accessibility
- Need to balance advanced drawing features with accessibility requirements

## Compliance

Our implementation meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards with the following exceptions:

- Canvas-based drawing operations may have limited keyboard accessibility
- Complex interactions may require alternative accessible workflows

We will continuously monitor and improve accessibility as the application evolves.
