# ADR 0002: Viewport-Based Culling for Canvas Rendering

## Date: 2024-04-21

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Large floor plans can contain thousands of objects, leading to performance issues when rendering the entire canvas at once. Key challenges include:

1. Poor performance when zooming/panning large plans
2. High memory usage from maintaining all objects
3. Reduced frame rates with complex drawings
4. Need to maintain visual quality at different zoom levels

## Decision

Implement viewport-based culling for canvas rendering with the following approach:

1. Only render objects visible within the current viewport
2. Implement a spatial indexing system for quick object lookup
3. Use different detail levels based on zoom level
4. Maintain a buffer zone around the viewport for smooth scrolling

Technical implementation:
- Integrate with Fabric.js rendering pipeline
- Implement efficient bounds checking
- Use Web Workers for spatial calculations
- Maintain object pools for recycling

## Consequences

### Benefits
- Significantly improved rendering performance
- Reduced memory usage
- Better handling of large floor plans
- Smoother zooming and panning

### Risks
- More complex rendering logic
- Potential edge cases during rapid viewport changes
- Need to carefully manage object lifecycle
- Possible artifacts during extreme zoom operations

### Mitigations
- Comprehensive testing of edge cases
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection
- Graceful degradation strategies
- Clear documentation of the culling system

## Implementation Plan

1. Implement basic viewport culling
2. Add spatial indexing
3. Optimize object pooling
4. Add performance monitoring
5. Document edge cases and limitations
