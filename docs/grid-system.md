# Grid System Architecture

## Overview

The grid system is a core feature of the application, providing a reliable framework for accurate drawing and measurement. It follows a layered architecture with multiple fallback mechanisms to ensure reliability.

## Grid Architecture Overview

The application's grid system follows a layered architecture:

1. **Core Grid Creation** (`gridCreationUtils.ts`):
   - Low-level grid creation functions
   - Multiple grid types with different complexities
   - Error recovery mechanisms

2. **Grid React Integration** (`SimpleGrid.tsx`):
   - React component for grid management
   - Grid state management
   - Integration with canvas lifecycle

3. **Grid Hooks** (`useGridCreation.ts`, `useGridRetry.ts`, etc.):
   - React hooks for grid operations
   - Safety and validation logic
   - Performance optimization

4. **Grid Diagnostics** (`gridDiagnostics.ts`):
   - Tools for debugging grid issues
   - Health check utilities
   - Grid recovery functions

## Key Modules

The `/utils/grid` directory contains specialized modules for grid management:

- `gridCreationUtils.ts`: Core functions for creating different types of grids
- `gridRenderers.ts`: Specialized grid rendering implementations
- `gridBasics.ts`: Basic grid utility functions
- `gridRetryUtils.ts`: Retry mechanisms with backoff
- `simpleGrid.ts`: Simple grid implementation
- `gridDiagnostics.ts`: Tools for grid debugging and health checks
- `gridDebugUtils.ts`: Developer-focused grid tools
- `gridValidator.ts`: Grid validation utilities

## Grid Creation Process

The grid creation follows a reliable process:

1. **Canvas Validation**:
   - Check if the canvas exists and is properly initialized
   - Validate canvas dimensions

2. **Grid Creation**:
   - Create grid objects (lines) based on canvas dimensions
   - Apply proper styling and properties
   - Add grid objects to canvas

3. **Grid Validation**:
   - Verify grid objects were properly created
   - Check if grid objects exist on canvas
   - Validate grid visibility

4. **Error Recovery**:
   - Retry grid creation with backoff if initial creation fails
   - Fall back to emergency grid if standard grid fails
   - Apply automatic fixes for common grid issues

## Working with Grid Functions

To work with the grid system, use these key functions:

```typescript
// Standard grid creation
const gridObjects = createCompleteGrid(canvas);

// Simple grid creation
const simpleGrid = createSimpleGrid(canvas);

// Reliable grid creation with safety checks
const reliableGrid = ensureGrid(canvas, gridLayerRef);

// Check if grid exists
const exists = verifyGridExists(canvas, gridObjects);

// Validate grid integrity
const isValid = validateGrid(canvas, gridObjects);

// Run diagnostics
const diagnostics = runGridDiagnostics(canvas, gridObjects);

// Clear grid
clearGrid(canvas, gridObjects);

// Fix grid issues
const fixCount = applyGridFixes(canvas, gridObjects);
```

## Error Recovery System

The grid system includes multiple layers of protection:

- Validation to prevent errors before they occur
- Multiple fallback methods for grid creation
- Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- Emergency grid creation when all else fails
- Detailed error logging and diagnostic information
