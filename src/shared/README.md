# Shared Directory

This directory contains shared utilities, components, and types used across multiple features.

## Structure

- `ui/` - Reusable UI components
- `types/` - TypeScript types and interfaces
- `utils/` - Shared utility functions

## Guidelines

1. Code in this directory should be feature-agnostic
2. Avoid dependencies on specific feature implementations
3. Focus on reusability and composability
4. Document APIs thoroughly
